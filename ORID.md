**R:** Tired, sleepy

**I:**

- I’ve learned a lot about API integration testing today. Many of these methods are applicable in real-world projects, which makes them highly practical.
- I don’t know if it’s because I’m sitting in the front row, but I’ve been feeling extremely sleepy these past couple of days.

**D:**

- Summarize the knowledge of API integration testing and apply it to future testing.
- Report in the daily stand-up with more confidence and capability.
